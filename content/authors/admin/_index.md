Welcome to my homepage! I am a PhD student at the  [Section for Prediction and Prevention of Mental Disorders](https://www.kambeitzlab.com) at the [University Hospital of Cologne, Germany](https://www.uk-koeln.de/en/), supervised by Joseph Kambeitz.

My research concerns the intersection of mental health, epidemiology, and methodology: I use data-driven statistical methods like probabilistic graphical modeling, machine learning and meta-analysis to reveal complex patterns in behavior, environment, and beyond. 

In my PhD project, I study transdiagnostic networks of individual symptoms of psychotic and affective disorders in cross-sectional as well as intensive longitudinal data. I am particularly interested in the role of early and recent stressful life events in onset, progression and maintenance of mental disorders.

My goal is to contribute to a paradigm shift towards personalized mental health care, aiming at better treatment with improved risk assessment and selection of tailored therapeutic strategies.

I enjoy spreading knowledge on how to use [R](https://www.r-project.org/), a free, open source platform for data analytics, statistics and visualization. I am a teaching assistant for courses in multivariate methods in mental health research, and give an annual introductory workshop on data management and analysis with R in our department, for participants with diverse backgrounds.
